			<h1> Zenless Zone Zero </h1>
			<p> Zenless Zone Zero (or zzz) is a hack n slash type game made by Hoyoverse, where you chain your attacks to gain points and defeat enemies. With a gacha system similar to genshin impact, You obtain agents by pulling on their banner. You do commisions to obtain dennies so you can upgrade your agents and their weapons.
